    //TwoSum problem
    /*Given an array of integers nums and and integer target, return the indices of the two numbers
    such that they add up to target.You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution,
    and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.*/
    var twoSum = function (nums, target) {
        const comp = {};
        for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (comp[nums[i]] >= 0) {
                return [comp[nums[i]], i]
            }
            comp[target - nums[i]] = i
        }
    };
    // twoSum(0,15);


    //Reverse Integer
    //    Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
    var reverse = function (x) {
        const limit = 2147483648;
        const k = x < 0 ? -1 : 1;
        const n = Number(String(Math.abs(x)).split('').reverse().join(''));
        return n > limit ? 0 : n * k;
    };
    // reverse(321);


    //palindrome number
    //Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the
    //same backward as forward.

    let isPalindrome = x => {
        if (x < 0 || x % 10 === 0 && x !== 0) return false;
        let reverse = 0;
        let num = x;
        while (num > reverse) {
            reverse = num % 10 + reverse * 10;
            num = parseInt(num / 10);
        }
        return (num === reverse || num === parseInt(reverse / 10));
    };
    // isPalindrome(1551);

    //Roman to integer

    /*Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

    Symbol       Value
    I             1
    V             5
    X             10
    L             50
    C             100
    D             500
    M             1000
    For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, XII, which is simply X + II.
    The number twenty seven is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

    Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is
    written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX.
    There are six instances where subtraction is used:

    I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
    X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
    C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
    Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.*/

    let romanToInt = s => {
        if (!s || s.length === 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        const map = new Map([['I', 1], ['V', 5], ['X', 10], ['L', 50], ['C', 100], ['D', 500], ['M', 1000]]);

        let i = s.length - 1;
        let result = map.get(s[i]);

        while (i > 0) {
            const curr = map.get(s[i]);
            const prev = map.get(s[i - 1]);

            if (prev >= curr) {
                result += prev;
            } else {
                result -= prev;
            }

            i--;
        }

        return result;
